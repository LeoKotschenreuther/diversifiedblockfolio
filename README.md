A tool to simplify investments in a diversified portfolio of blockchain coins and tokes.

## Idea

Investing in more than a couple of different blockchain assets can be quite tedious, especially when some are only traded in bitcoin or ether but not in fiat currencies. The idea of this python tool is to help you invest into a blockchain portfolio following a predefined asset allocation. Once complete, it shall support three different actions. All of them try to rebalance the portfolio to its original asset allocation as much as possible:

* Deposits
* Rebalance
* Withdrawals
