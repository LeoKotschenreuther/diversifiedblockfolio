# A list of all the assets you would like to hold.
# Each asset needs the following attributes:
#   name            - The name of the asset
#   quote_currency  - What currency should be used to buy the asset
#   exchange        - The name of the exchange where to buy the asset
#   weight          - How much weight the asset should have compared to the other assets
#   storage         - Where you want to store the asset. This can be "exchange" or "wallet"
# 
# A note on the weight of the assets:
# The weight can be any float number, e.g. it could represent a value in percent or a rating from 1 to 10.
# The tool will calculate the sum of the weights and then distribute the value of the blockfolio
# accordingly by dividing each assets weight by the sum of all assets weights.
